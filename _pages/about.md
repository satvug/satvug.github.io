Hi there, I'm Gustav 👋  I'm a software developer based in Copenhagen, Denmark. My passion for programming started early in my life, where I would make modifications to my favorite video games. I later knew that I wanted to pursue the path of becoming a software developer, which is why I decided to get a master's in Computer Science.

<h2>technical skills</h2>
I am experienced in the following technologies:
<ul>
  <li>C# .NET, Java, C, Python, Microsoft SQL</li>
  <li>Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS</li>
  <li>Version Control: Git, SVN</li>
  <li>Tools: Visual Studio, Webstorm, VSCode</li>
</ul>

<h2>hobbies</h2>

In my spare time, when I'm not working on my hobby programming projects, I enjoy taking photos and keeping myself fit.
I'm also an avid traveler and love exploring new places. In 2020, my favorite destinations were Barcelona and Lisbon.
